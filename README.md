# Perimeter
This project will solve your mathematical problems on shapes for you. 
In this project I made a program where you can draw any shape with any number of points, any angles and any dimensions. 
And it will do the rest for you. It will do any operation on this shape and get you any piece of information. 
It calculates the perimeter of the shape, number of points in the shape, longest distance, average one and so more other. 
It doesn't work only with one shape but so many shapes together as well. 
It is a simple project that does too much and ease math for you.
